# Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18.20.2 installed. Use `yarn` to install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, you can use any of the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

### Editing the Code

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. Changes will automatically reflect in the browser as you save the file.

### Fonts

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for optimizing and loading fonts, including the [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) family from Vercel.

## Notes

- The UI is kept simple due to time constraints but delivers the expected user experience and functionality.
- Local data is used for convenience and time-saving.
- The project is deployed at: [https://aydi.vercel.app/](https://aydi.vercel.app/).
